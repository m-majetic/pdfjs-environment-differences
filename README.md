# PDF.js environment parsing differences

There is a difference between the hashes generated from the opList and the commonObj objects in the Node.js and the front-end environment.
This example is supposed to allow anyone to preview the difference.

This repository is supposed to be a resource for an issue that will be opened for the PDF.js library.

### How to run

#### Front-end
Running the Front-end example should be straightforward, just open the HTML and inspect the console output.

#### Back-end
```
cd back-end
npm install
node pdf-testing.js
```

And observe the console output.
